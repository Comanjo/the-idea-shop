# The Idea Shop

>  Exploration of building an e-commerce application where you can build your ideas and dreams

## Motivation

Their are many various ways to build out projects and it would be a disservice to developers to say something like these are my opinions in the form of how I would build out an e-commerce like application.

As an instructor--I'm always trying to mimic a workplace by using tooling and practices to teach students as quickly as possible.
like a shopping cart for the first time.

The process in seeing something like a shopping cart built in a manner to start a discussion, and hopefully--the right discussion to talk about the necessary nuances of being an engineer and having an abstract idea of what the problem is
that I'm actually trying to solve.

***The Idea Shop***--where some ideas are born.

### Getting Started

Clone (and fork if you'd like to contribute to) this repository to a directory on your computer. Navigate to that directory within your terminal and install your dependencies with either **NPM** or **YARN**

```bash
// Using NPM to install the dependencies
npm install

// Using YARN to install the dependencies
yarn install
```

If the application starts up, it should open up a browser, and you should see (the first time and unmodified and working) `The Idea Shop` in a working form form.

#### Run Tests (Optional)

```bash
npm test
yarn test

/*
 In the future, I'll use a new syntax (like (npm|yarn) [command])--when they share the same name like test.  For example, it would look like this below.
*/

// The test command
(npm|yarn) test
```
